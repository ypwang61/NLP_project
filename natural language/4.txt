Start the experiment by collecting sample data as input and preparing the laboratory equipment. Label the samples and measure the initial conditions. If the sample reacts, record the reaction and analyze the data. If the results are significant, publish the findings. Otherwise, review the methodology and start the experiment again with a new approach. If there is no reaction, store the samples for further analysis, concluding the experiment.
