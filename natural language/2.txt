The morning starts and if feeling unwell, consult a doctor. If a prescription is given, then take medication; otherwise, use home remedies. If not feeling unwell, exercise and eat healthily. Hydrate throughout the day and then check health status at the end of the day. If feeling better, continue the routine; otherwise, rest and consider visiting the doctor tomorrow. The night then ends.
