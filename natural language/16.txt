We start by checking if the popcorn is ready. If popcorn is ready, we then pick a movie and based on the genre of the movie, we may either turn off the lights if it's a Horror movie, invite friends over if it's a Comedy movie, or grab a cozy blanket if it's animated movie, after that we play the movie. However, if the popcorn is not ready we go to the kitchen, make popcorn, and repeat the process of checking. The whole process ends when the movie ends.
