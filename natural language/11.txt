Begin the entertainment routine. If the weather is nice, then go for a hike, indicating an outdoor activity; otherwise, choose a movie genre. Depending on the movie genre chosen, if it is Comedy, then watch a comedy movie, leading to laughs; if Horror, then watch a horror movie, leading to screams; and if it is any other genre, then do a movie marathon. Finally, relax and enjoy, marking the end of the entertainment.
