First, check the balance. If there are enough funds for investment, then choose the type of investment. Depending on the investment type chosen, if it is Stocks, buy stocks. If it is Bonds, buy bonds. If it is a Savings account, deposit in the savings account. If there are not enough funds for investment, save more money. Next, evaluate financial goals. If short-term goals are met, celebrate; otherwise, adjust the budget. Similarly, if long-term goals are met, plan for retirement; otherwise, consult a financial advisor. Finally, review the budget.
