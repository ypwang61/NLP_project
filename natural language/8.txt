Visit the art gallery. If you see a painting you like, then take a closer look. If you want to learn more about it, then ask the curator about the painting; otherwise, if you are just admiring, then appreciate silently. If you do not see a painting you like, then move to the next painting. If you are tired, then sit in the gallery cafe and enjoy a coffee; otherwise, continue exploring. This marks the end of the visit.
