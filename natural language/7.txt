Begin the exploration of history. If there is an interest in Ancient Civilizations, one should read about Egypt. Should there be more time available, then explore the Pyramids; otherwise, watch a documentary on Rome. If not interested in Ancient Civilizations, then discover medieval Europe and visit a castle. End the journey through time.
