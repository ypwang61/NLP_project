Prepare for the journey. If the bag is already packed, proceed to check the weather and ensure flight tickets and passport are ready. If not, pack the essentials first. Next, choose a destination. Based on the type of destination, if it's a beach, pack sunscreen; if it's the mountains, pack warm clothes. Finally, enjoy the travel.
