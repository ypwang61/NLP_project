Start the business plan. If the market research is done, then analyze the competition and identify the target audience; otherwise, return to the previous step. Calculate the startup costs and plan the budget with a monthly plan. If the funds are sufficient, seek investments; if not, reduce expenses. Develop the marketing plan, launch the marketing campaign, and monitor and adjust the strategy. End the business plan.
