The process starts by choosing a game genre. Depending on what genre is selected, different actions will be carried out. If a shooter is selected, a first-person shooter game is loaded. If a role-playing game is selected, a fantasy game is loaded. For a strategy genre, a tactics game is loaded. If a sports genre is chosen, a football game is loaded. If no genre is selected, no game will be loaded and the process will end. After a game is loaded, it is then played. If the player enjoyed the game, the game will be saved. If the player didn't enjoy the game, the game will be quit. The process ends at this point.
