Start the education journey. If there is an interest in Science, explore Physics and experiment with Chemicals. Otherwise, read about History and draw Maps. Next, choose a major. Depending on the Major chosen, if it's Arts, attend painting classes; if Engineering, solve math problems; or if Literature, write essays. Prepare for exams and while exams are not passed, study and take mock tests. After passing, graduate and obtain a degree. Then, search for a job. If a job is found in the field, celebrate; otherwise, consider further studies. End the education journey.
