fig. number-tk the architecture of the adversarial drl algorithm for robust av control. a deep neural network (dnn) consisting of a long short term memory (lstm), a fully connected layer (fcl), and regression is used to learn longterm dependencies within a large data sets, which contain the outcomes of the playersâ€™ past interactions. the dnn can approximate the q functions to find optimal actions for players, i.e., av (defender) and especially attacker, who seeks to inject faulty data to av sensor readings.
