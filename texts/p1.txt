fig. number-tk general framework of quantum capsule networks (qcapsnets). the input data is first preprocessed in the previous layers to extract some preliminary features. within qcapsnets, there are multiple capsules in each layer. each capsule contains a group of interacting qubits, which forms a sub-quantum neural network (subqnn). the output states of the sub-qnn are represented by quantum states living in the hilbert space, which encode features of the entities. different capsules can represent different entities, such as ears, eyes and mouth of the panda. the information is processed layer by layer via a quantum dynamic routing algorithm. during the routing procedure, the probability that the lower-level capsule are assigned to the higher-level one will be updated with their geometric agreements. as such, higher-level capsules can not only recognize the active entities in the lower layer, but also preserve their geometric relationships. the magnitude of the output capsule indicates the classification probability.
