figure number-tk the overview of the proposed self-supervised robustifying guidance (rogue) framework. rogue addresses the occlusion and noise problems in face images for 3d face reconstruction by the proposed image- and feature-level loss functions in the self-supervised fashion, enforcing to occluded and noise coefficients to be consistent with the target coefficients of the guiding image, without the requirement of 3d ground truth face scans and any additional dependency for the training.
