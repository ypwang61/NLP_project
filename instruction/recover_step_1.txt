You will be given an image generated by the diffusion model. However, the text within it is of poor quality. Your job is to predict the text within the red box. You should finish the task in two steps:
+ Recognize the text within the red box by pixel-level similarity. Please don’t call OAR tools, just look at the image yourself and identify the text within the red box.
+ Correct the text to make it fluent given its visual position in the image, its relative position to other visual elements and the language information you get from the recognized text. If you really can’t correct the text, you should just output “I don’t know” in <corrected text> section, but I hope you can try you best to correct the text.
Please refer to the following example for reporting format.
<recognized text>
turpion
<\recognized text>
<reasoning for corrected text>
The image seems to talk about the heavy burden student loan, and “turpion” is the origins of the flowchart. This indicates “turpion” may originally be “tuition”.
<\reasoning for corrected text>
<corrected text>
tuition
<\corrected text>
