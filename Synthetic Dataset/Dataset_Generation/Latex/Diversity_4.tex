Diversity refers to the recognition and appreciation of individual differences in workplaces, schools, and societies. It spans numerous dimensions including race, ethnicity, gender, religion, age, sexual orientation, and disabilities. Embracing diversity leads to a rich exchange of ideas, improved decision-making, increased innovation, and higher customer satisfaction. Furthermore, it fosters mutual respect, personal growth, and a more harmonious society.
