Financial markets provide a platform for buyers and sellers to trade assets such as stocks, bonds, currencies, derivatives, and commodities. There are two broad types: Capital markets which include stock and bond markets and Money markets that deal in short-term debt investments. These markets play a crucial role in overall economic stability and growth by providing companies with capital and investors with income.
