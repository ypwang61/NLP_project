\begin{block}{\textbf{Importance of Product, Price, Place, and Promotion in Marketing}}
The key aspects of any marketing strategy are often referred to as the “4 P’s of Marketing.” These are the product (what you are selling), price (how much you're selling it for), place (where it's being sold), and promotion (how you're getting the word out). These elements must be carefully considered and aligned to ensure a successful marketing plan.
