\begin{block}{\textbf{The Importance of Communication in Relationships}}

Effective communication entails not merely verbalising thoughts but also actively listening to the other person.

\begin{block}{\textbf{The Role of Trust in Maintaining Relationships}}
Trust, undoubtedly, is the bedrock of all relationships. It provides a safe space for vulnerability, enabling us to share personal aspects without the fear of judgement. Encroachment on trust often precipitates conflicts and resentments, potentially damaging the relationship.
