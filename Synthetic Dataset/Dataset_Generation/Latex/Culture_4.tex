\begin{block}{\textbf{Definition and Importance of Culture}}
Culture refers to the values, norms, traditions, and artifacts that define a group of people and create their distinct identity. It shapes our relationships, behavior, and perceptions, acting as a lens through which we view the world. Appreciating cultural diversity can promote mutual respect and reduce prejudices and discrimination. It's a societal glue, holding people together and fostering a sense of belonging and community.
