\begin{block}{\textbf{Decline in biodiversity due to global warming.}}
As global temperatures rise, numerous species are facing the risk of extinction. Changes in climate patterns directly affect the habitats and food sources of animals, making their survival problematic. Cold-weather animals like polar bears are particularly impacted due to melting ice caps. This loss of biodiversity is not only an environmental issue but also poses a threat to our food security and health.
