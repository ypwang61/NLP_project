\begin{block}{\textbf{The cyclic nature of fashion trends}}
Fashion trends are known to come back in style after a certain period, making it cyclical in nature. Trends from the '60s and '70s, like bell-bottom trousers and fringed jackets, have made a comeback in recent years. This nature of fashion shows that while trends may fade, they are never entirely forgotten. Being aware of past trends can play a pivotal role in anticipating future fashion styles.
