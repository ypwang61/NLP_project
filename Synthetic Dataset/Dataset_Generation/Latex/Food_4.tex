Food not only satisfies our hunger but also provides essential nutrients to our body. A balanced diet ensures sufficient intake of proteins, fibers, vitamins, minerals, fatty acids, and carbohydrates. This fosters healthy body growth and reduces the risk of diseases, enhancing overall well-being. It's noteworthy that the quality and quantity of food are equally important for maintaining optimal health.
