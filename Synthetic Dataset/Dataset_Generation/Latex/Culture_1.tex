\begin{block}{\textbf{Defining Culture}}
Culture is a complex framework of norms, values, practices, and artifacts that define a social group or society. It is a shared set of beliefs and customs that are learned and passed down from generation to generation. Culture impacts every aspect of life, from individual behavior to societal structures, and informs our worldviews and perspectives. Therefore, effective intercultural understanding and exchange demand a deep familiarity with culture's foundations, functions, and complexities.
